Permafrost melting has become common in parts of the Northwest Territories (NT), resulting in retrogressive thaw slumps along the margins of lakes. Recent studies have documented changes in water quality caused by these slumps, including increased turbidity, conductivity, and nutrient levels. However, the degree to which melting permafrost impacts water quality may not be uniform throughout the NT due to differences in soil types among regions as a result of differing glaciation histories. Research has not been conducted to determine how physical and chemical changes driven by melting permafrost might impact invertebrate communities in NT lakes. It is important to understand impacts on zooplankton and benthic macroinvertebrates, as they play an important role in aquatic food webs, transferring energy from primary producers to larger organisms such as fish and waterbirds. The proposed research will examine the impact of melting permafrost conducting a survey of 60 lakes to examine the main variables that impact the distribution and abundance of zooplankton in NT lakes. This survey will identify if variables likely to be impacted by permafrost thaw, such as salinity or turbidity, are important for determining which species of zooplankton can inhabit each lake. With this information, we will be able to assess the potential long-term impacts of permafrost thaw.
