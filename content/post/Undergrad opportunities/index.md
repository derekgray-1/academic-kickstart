If you are looking to gain experience in a laboratory, and are **interested in ecology**, we often have volunteer opportunities for undergraduates. These positions are often 6-10 hours per week during the semester and involve assisting graduate students with their research projects. Please contact Derek (dgray@wlu.ca) with a description of your background and interests to inquire about positions.
